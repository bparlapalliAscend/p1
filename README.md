# Project 1


### Description
This project is to get familiar with creating local and live servers, creating a github repo as well as connecting all three using github

 Project 1 (this project) contains a basic html, a base css file and an image file
 
 The image file is big and might take longer to load if its a slower net connection. the other images I had got too pixellated.
